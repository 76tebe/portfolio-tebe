          Hey there! I'm Tebe, an adventurer in the design world who traded
          pixels for passion. Graduating from Brawijaya University with an
          Information Systems degree, my journey began in the tech trenches of
          our university community.
        </p>
        <p>
          From graphic design and photo editing escapades to the wild world of
          UX, I've got an audacious spirit as a Product Designer. I've battled
          it out in national design competitions, crafting digital wonders,
          snagging awards, and dropping knowledge bombs along the way.

          Off the design grid, you'll find me lacing up for a game of futsal or
          football&#9135;my go-to escapes when I'm not immersed in the design
          world. My love for cats isn't just a card-carrying affair&#9135;it's a
          full-on commitment to playing and bonding with these whiskered
          companions. They're not just pets; they're my stress-relief partners,
          adding a touch of purr-fection to life.
        </p>

          In downtime, tunes from Laufey and Rich Brian set the backdrop for my
          whimsical adventures. Gaming? It's not just a pastime; it's a journey
          into pixels with a side of laughter.
